        # What is self.model() in django custom UserManager
        
        # Well what you define here is a UserManager class. This inherits from
        # the BaseUserManager class. This is a subclass of the Manager class.
        # You actually use manager all the time. For example SomeModel.objects
        # is a manager.

        # A manager has, if it is used, a reference to the model it manages.
        # So SomeModel.objects is a manager, but that manager has an attribute
        # .model that actually refers back to the SomeModel class.

        # In this case your self.model will refer to User model

        # Q: using model.save() from django shell will not validate the data

        # Creating an instance of a Model and calling save on that instance
        # does not call full_clean. Therefore it’s possible for invalid data
        # to enter your database if you don’t manually call the full_clean
        # function before saving.

        # Object managers’ default create function also doesn’t call full_clean.

        # But in general, it's not good practice to add validation in the
        # save() method. The reason is that in most Django apps, you'd create
        # a form (a ModelForm) which would call the validation methods and be
        # able to return something meaningful to the user when validation
        # fails.

        # When the model's save() method is called it's too late to show
        # something to the user, so you can only raise an exception at that
        # point (and crash).

        # The normal procedure (which the admin forms use) is: validate the
        # form by calling form.is_valid() (which calls full_clean() on the
        # model), then if and only if the form is valid, save the model.

        # The shell is not the regular interaction method and should be used
        # only very carefully as it bypasses the normal flow of the
        # application.
