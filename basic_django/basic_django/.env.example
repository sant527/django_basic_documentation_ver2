# even we keep the variable empty but if its used in the settigns.py (e.g env('ALLOWED_HOSTS')) it has to be mentioned here else it will show error. Thats why we use environ.Env( ALLOWED_HOSTS=(list, ['127.0.0.1:8000'])) to set default value in the settings.py
# never use comments on the same line eg:
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'somepass' #enter pass
# in settings env('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD') value is ('somepass' #enter pass). Even (#enter pass) is included. So it does not recognize # as comment. So put comments only on the top or bottom of line
